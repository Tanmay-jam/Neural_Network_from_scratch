There are many options for deep learning libraries available. which are really good.
Here we will try to create neural networks from scratch to understand it's working.

This will be done in python and primary dependancy required is numpy library.

To make our code more efficient and modular we will try to use OOP whenever possible.

Files:

activation.py :  This contains class for activation functions, sigmoid, ReLU, Leaky ReLu, Adaline and tanh.
NN_object.py : This contains class for basic structure of neuron to define number of inputs, weights and activation function of a neuron.( It inherites activation function's class)
create_neuron : It is example of how a neuron is created.
